       "9                                      The reason we need insulin—as a hormone made in our bodies or as a medication—is to push glucose into cells for energy. Insulin’s job is to process calories. For this reason, it can—but doesn’t have to—cause weight gain. To prevent weight gain: Practice portion control. Burn extra calories with exercise. If your blood sugar has been high for a while prior to starting insulin, you’ve likely been excreting calories in your urine instead of fueling your body. This won’t happen once your blood sugar is under control. If you experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), treat it with just 15 grams of carb.  \n",

Insulin, a hormone created in the pancreas, enables glucose from your food to be transferred from blood to your cells in order to provide energy for your body. When glucose is not properly processed or if not enough insulin is created to help the processing, glucose is trapped in the blood and cannot reach your cells. The A1C test is a widely used blood test to diagnose type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If you already have diabetes, the A1C test is also used to track your blood glucose levels to help manage your condition.  \n",

       "2  Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes People with type 2 diabetes produce insulin like anyone else, but their bodies are unable to process it effectively. People most at risk for developing type 2 diabetes: have a family history of diabetes are 45 or older are overweight are physically inactive/lack a regular exercise routine have high blood pressure. Type 1 diabetes is marked by the inability of the body to produce any insulin. This is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes include: family history of type 1 diabetes, family history of type 1 diabetes, younger age—most common among children and adolescents geography—occurs more often in populations living further from the equator. Prediabetes is a condition in which you have higher than normal levels of glucose in your blood, but not enough to warrant a diagnosis for type 2 diabetes. With healthy changes in your diet and/or lifestyle activities, prediabetes is reversible and can be prevented from developing into diabetes. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and can affect a baby’s health. However, it can be controlled through healthy eating, exercise, and medications. Blood glucose levels typically return to normal after delivery. If you’ve had gestational diabetes, you could be at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes later, so talk to your doctor to manage your blood glucose going forward.\\n\\n\\n  \n",

Oral medications help the insulin the body produces be more effective in processing glucose. Insulin injected through a syringe or delivered by an insulin pump mimics the way the pancreas would naturally produce and distribute insulin.  \n",

As part of this plan, or in addition to it, you can monitor several areas of your health to help reduce complications caused by diabetes. Keep close watch over your blood glucose Pay attention to your blood pressure—adjust diet and lifestyle choices to help lower it\\nWatch cholesterol levels, Maintain the health of your kidneys—consult your doctor or a nephrologist to have a microalbumin test at least once every year, Get your foot examined by a professional once a year\\n\\n\\n  "

If your blood sugar has been high for a while prior to starting insulin, you've likely been excreting calories in your urine instead of fueling your body.

Weight loss increases insulin sensitivity, allowing cells to more effectively use the insulin the body continues to make. Losing just 10–20 pounds can accomplish a boatload of benefits.

Progesterone can do the converse,\" says Natalie Strand, M.D., of the University of Southern California. Strand was the first person with diabetes to win The Amazing Race TV show. Glucose levels often return to their usual patterns after the first few days of the menstrual cycle. \"Check your glucose levels and analyze your monthly fluctuations to know your patterns,\" she says. Then devise a management plan for these days. Menopause also can affect blood sugar. \"During perimenopause, estrogen and progesterone can fluctuate and lead to glucose swings,\" Strand says.

Research indicates that if type 2 diabetes is treated early and blood sugar is controlled initially and over the years, the pancreas is more likely to produce enough insulin longer. But a person who lives with type 2 upward of 15 years is unlikely to continue to make sufficient insulin and will need to take it via syringe, pen, or pump.  \n",

Insulin's job is to process calories. For this reason, it can-but doesn't have to-cause weight gain. To prevent weight gain: Practice portion control. Burn extra calories with exercise. If your blood sugar has been high for a while prior to starting insulin, you've likely been excreting calories in your urine instead of fueling your body. This won't happen once your blood sugar is under control. If you experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), treat it with just 15 grams of carb.  \n",

       "10  Yes and yes! It's common for women to have hormone fluctuations the week before their period, and those can affect glucose control. After ovulating, estrogen and progesterone rise. \"Estrogen can make women more sensitive to insulin and cause hypoglycemia. Progesterone can do the converse,\" says Natalie Strand, M.D., of the University of Southern California. Strand was the first person with diabetes to win The Amazing Race TV show. Glucose levels often return to their usual patterns after the first few days of the menstrual cycle. \"Check your glucose levels and analyze your monthly fluctuations to know your patterns,\" she says. Then devise a management plan for these days. Menopause also can affect blood sugar. \"During perimenopause, estrogen and progesterone can fluctuate and lead to glucose swings,\" Strand says. An early sign of perimenopause for women who take insulin is hypoglycemia due to dropping progesterone.  \n",

Some medications can cause hypoglycemia, including insulin; those in the sulfonylurea category, such as glyburide (Diabeta, Glynase, Micronase), glipizide (Glucotrol), and glimepiride (Amaryl); and those in the glinide category, such as repaglinide (Prandin) and nateglinide (Starlix). If you take one of these medications, always carry treatment. Most of the commonly used blood glucose-lowering medications for type 2 diabetes don't cause hypoglycemia.  \n",

Research shows that the earlier your diabetes is diagnosed and the sooner you start to aggressively get your blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol into target ranges, the healthier you can be over the years. To stay healthy and detect any complications early, make sure your health care provider orders all the tests and checks you need. Let your provider know if you have any signs or symptoms of a potential problem. Today, diabetes complications don't need to happen.  \n",

In this case, you'll likely need to take insulin injections the rest of your life. If, however, you started taking insulin when you had an infection, needed surgery, or were hospitalized for a medical reason, your need for insulin may be temporary. These situations raise stress, and stress can raise blood sugar levels. When the stress abates, you may be able to taper or stop taking insulin and get back to your previous medication regimen.  \n",

It's easy to understand why motivation waxes and wanes. BJ Fogg, director of the Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford University and a leading expert on human behavior change, offers some tips to help get started: Move away from all-or-nothing thinking, Don't judge yourself as bad or good, Make one tiny habit change after another. Experience success, then change another tiny habit, then another. Eventually you'll experience \"success momentum.\" Fogg recommends starting by changing what you already want to change, not what you know you should change but don't really want to.  "

Although most type 1 diabetes can be managed with insulin, a healthy diet, exercise, and regular blood glucose testing, some people will need additional treatment. You may also need other medications if you’re managing other conditions in addition to diabetes. For example, since type 1 diabetes increases your risk for heart disease, your doctor may prescribe additional medication if you have high cholesterol or high blood pressure. They may also recommend daily aspirin to protect against heart attack and improve circulation.  \n",

While there are common symptoms — weakness, fatigue, tingling in the fingers — not everyone with type 1 diabetes will experience them, according to Diabetes UK. This is especially true for people who have had the condition for a long time. More frequent blood sugar testing, or the use of an insulin pump or continuous glucose monitor can help. You should also work with your healthcare team, who may adjust your blood sugar targets to help avoid episodes of low blood sugar, notes the ADA.  \n",

Work with your care team to develop an exercise plan and insulin regimen that works for you, and expect some trial and error. Using a continuous glucose monitor during exercise can help you determine how exercise affects you, and provide a guide for insulin dosing. In addition to adjusting your insulin, your care team can help you adjust your carb intake before and after exercise to maintain healthy blood glucose levels.  \n",

       "15  Ketoacidosis is the build-up of ketones (a by-product of rapid fat breakdown in the body) and can be life-threatening if left untreated.  This would generally not occur unless glucose levels were very elevated over a longer period where the cells, needing fuel, rapidly break down fat to help keep you alive.  At that point, one may be in a diabetic coma.  In pregnancy, it is important for good control to prevent ketoacidosis so ketone bodies do not form, as they can cross the placenta and be toxic to the fetus.  Symptoms may include fruity smelling breath, high blood sugar, excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea and vomiting.  If concerned, you can buy strips at the pharmacy to test urine for the presence of ketones.  \n",

There are many nerve endings in your tips, and this area can be very sensitive. The good news is that the meters today require very little blood.

In my many years of counseling, I have seen very few folks with a BMI over 30 - in the obese classification - that don't have elevated or elevating glucose. Increased body fat appears to interfere at the cellular level with the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into the cell: the job of insulin. This creates a condition called insulin resistance. Unless lifestyle changes are made towards better eating habits and activity, pre-diabetes will usually blossom into diabetes.  \n",

The first goal would be to maintain stable glucose levels, as fluctuating levels can certainly affect good sleep. A cup of hot herbal sleep tea 1/2 before bed may help him relax and be able to fall asleep easier. Supplementing with Melatonin, a sleep hormone produced by the body, can often help. Quieting his mind is key; some people benefit by listening to relaxation tapes at night. Exercise during the day can also make for better sleep at night. The most important factor is that he wants to take steps to sleep better and overall maintain a better quality of life.  \n",

It is even less likely if you live a healthy lifestyle for both diet and activity. You can have your insulin output measured with a C-Peptide test. If your body truly no longer makes insulin, as the case with type 1 diabetes, and you are not injecting insulin, you will die. There are those with type 2 diabetes who do require insulin to have any semblance of good levels, but can survive without insulin for some period of time, but with high levels.    \n",

As a general rule, we say piercings/tattoos are not good ideas because they can be an invitation to infection. I suggest you consult with the nurse in her physician's practice. The conditions would have to be most sterile for any piercings - or pedicures for that matter. If your daughter's blood sugars are in exquisite control, and your medical team knows of a place that has met some standard, then something small may work, particularly if your daughter is rebellious, and would go out and do this on her own, but in poor conditions. Weigh and balance your decision after some detective work.  \n",

There are those who still produce some insulin, but not at sufficient amounts so to control their blood sugars without taking insulin. This is referred to as type 1.5 diabetes. Your physician can order a C-Peptide test which can give you some idea of how much insulin your pancreas is producing. Type 1 diabetes often comes on fast and strong, with rapid weight loss, thirst, frequent urination, then stabilizes for a period until the cells stop insulin production. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1.  \n",

This was at the same time that rapid-acting insulin came to market, which allowed much more flexibility in the diet. For an easy comparison, one tablespoon of honey or table sugar equals 15 grams of carbohydrate, and affects blood sugar the same as a medium orange. Honey can be a carbohydrate choice as part of a balanced snack, such as using a teaspoon with plain Greek yogurt, which adds the equivalent of 5 grams of carbohydrate.

       "0   Table sugar and honey were added to the ADA’s list of food choices many years ago, when nutrition research determined that a carbohydrate is a carbohydrate. This was at the same time that rapid-acting insulin came to market, which allowed much more flexibility in the diet. For an easy comparison, one tablespoon of honey or table sugar equals 15 grams of carbohydrate, and affects blood sugar the same as a medium orange. Honey can be a carbohydrate choice as part of a balanced snack, such as using a teaspoon with plain Greek yogurt, which adds the equivalent of 5 grams of carbohydrate. If you want to save your calorie and carbohydrate budget for a meal, you can use a sugar substitute that is calorie free. The choice is yours!  \n",

When it comes to diabetes, carbohydrate is looked at per meal and snack, not per day. This is because an insulin bolus needs to be taken when carbohydrate is consumed, unless one is treating a low blood sugar. Sugar Surfing is a method that one noted endocrinologist uses to manage blood sugar based on carbs consumed at a meal. You can learn more at sugarsurfing.com.  \n",

There are those who still produce some insulin, but not at sufficient amounts so to control their blood sugars without taking insulin. This is referred to as type 1.5 diabetes. Your physician can order a C-Peptide test which can give you some idea of how much insulin your pancreas is producing. Type 1 diabetes often comes on fast and strong, with rapid weight loss, thirst, frequent urination, then stabilizes for a period until the cells stop insulin production. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1.  \n",

If your medications are in order, eating high-fiber foods and limiting carbohydrate intake will help prevent a spike. Also, including a small amount of healthy fat can help to stabilize blood sugar.  \n",

If your blood sugar is below target range at bedtime, a very general guideline would be to consume 15 grams of carbohydrate and a protein serving. This could be half of a sandwich, some apple slices and peanut butter, or a high-fiber cereal with milk. This snack recommendation varies based on age, medications/insulin, and many other health factors. Ask your HCP about your bedtime snack needs. They may opt to decrease your medication or insulin dose instead of adding a snack to prevent nighttime lows.  \n",

Is there a chance that a blood test is wrong?Type 1 diabetes means that without taking insulin, you cannot live. There are those who still produce some insulin, but not at sufficient amounts so to control their blood sugars without taking insulin. This is referred to as type 1.5 diabetes. Your physician can order a C-Peptide test which can give you some idea of how much insulin your pancreas is producing. Type 1 diabetes often comes on fast and strong, with rapid weight loss, thirst, frequent urination, then stabilizes for a period until the cells stop insulin production. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1.  \n",

With insulin-requiring diabetes, this can be an even greater challenge to maintain stable blood sugars, but is very achievable with the right monitoring and support. Having a disease like diabetes does provide greater challenges for stable health and moods, but does not negate the ability to attain and maintain them.  \n",

I am 19 years old and very overweight. I recently took my blood sugar a few times and the results scared me: 170 when I woke up. Changing your lifestyle which will ultimately result in body composition changes and weight reduction can certainly keep diabetes in check. You surely have a wake-up call, and now is the time to get guidance in eating and begin a regular exercise program. Be most dedicated to yourself now, as 170 fasting would indicate diabetes. With perseverance, you can stay in control.  \n",

My recent blood test showed that my pancreas is 1.5 and I understand this is very low.Yes, you can become type 1 after years of being type 2. What this would mean is that you cannot live without taking insulin. It sounds as though you had a C-Peptide test, and discovered that your insulin reserves are low. If you have a practitioner in your area who understands nutritional therapies, this may help preserve and improve what insulin production you have. Eat whole, unrefined, organic foods as much as possible. Stay active, and work on the \"tough\" one: stress reduction.  \n",

What are the chances that my child will develop type 1 as well?While there is a genetic component to type 1 diabetes, environmental factors play a role as well. Research suggests that genes account for less than halfthe risk for developing type 1 diabetes. 90% of children who develop type 1 diabetes do not have a relative with this disease and it is reported that only 15% of people with type 1 diabetes have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, with diabetes. There are certain genes called HLA markers associated with diabetes risk which can be identified at birth. Research is ongoing and very active in the field of diabetes and genetic markers soupdated information could be available in the near future.  \n",
