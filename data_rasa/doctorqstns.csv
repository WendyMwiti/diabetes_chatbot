What is diabetes and how can I be tested for it?,"Diabetes is a condition in which your blood sugar, or blood glucose, rises to unhealthy levels. Insulin, a hormone created in the pancreas, enables glucose from your food to be transferred from blood to your cells in order to provide energy for your body. When glucose is not properly processed or if not enough insulin is created to help the processing, glucose is trapped in the blood and cannot reach your cells. The A1C test is a widely used blood test to diagnose type 1 and type 2 diabetes. If you already have diabetes, the A1C test is also used to track your blood glucose levels to help manage your condition."
What health problems does it cause?,Many conditions caused by diabetes can be serious and even life threatening. These include: Heart disease High blood pressure Stroke Kidney disease Eye damage Foot problems

People most at risk for developing type 2 diabetes: have a family history of diabetes are 45 or older are overweight are physically inactive/lack a regular exercise routine have high blood pressure. Type 1 diabetes is marked by the inability of the body to produce any insulin. This is caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking and destroying insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Risk factors for type 1 diabetes include: family history of type 1 diabetes, family history of type 1 diabetes, younger age—most common among children and adolescents geography—occurs more often in populations living further from the equator. Prediabetes is a condition in which you have higher than normal levels of glucose in your blood, but not enough to warrant a diagnosis for type 2 diabetes. With healthy changes in your diet and/or lifestyle activities, prediabetes is reversible and can be prevented from developing into diabetes. Gestational diabetes develops during pregnancy and can affect a baby’s health. However, it can be controlled through healthy eating, exercise, and medications. Blood glucose levels typically return to normal after delivery. If you’ve had gestational diabetes, you could be at higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes later, so talk to your doctor to manage your blood glucose going forward.
