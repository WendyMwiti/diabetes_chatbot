"Is honey ok to use if I have diabetes, and in what proportion? Or should I try something like Stevia or Swerve?","Table sugar and honey were added to the ADA’s list of food choices many years ago, when nutrition research determined that a carbohydrate is a carbohydrate. This was at the same time that rapid-acting insulin came to market, which allowed much more flexibility in the diet. For an easy comparison, one tablespoon of honey or table sugar equals 15 grams of carbohydrate, and affects blood sugar the same as a medium orange. Honey can be a carbohydrate choice as part of a balanced snack, such as using a teaspoon with plain Greek yogurt, which adds the equivalent of 5 grams of carbohydrate. If you want to save your calorie and carbohydrate budget for a meal, you can use a sugar substitute that is calorie free. The choice is yours!"
What are the nutritional recommendations for individuals (adults) with type 1 diabetes in terms of daily carbohydrate intake? How does this mesh (if at all) with low-carb diets?,"The meal plan recommendations for people with type 1 diabetes are individualized, and yes, some people choose a low-carb diet or even a very low-carb diet. When it comes to diabetes, carbohydrate is looked at per meal and snack, not per day. This is because an insulin bolus needs to be taken when carbohydrate is consumed, unless one is treating a low blood sugar. Sugar Surfing is a method that one noted endocrinologist uses to manage blood sugar based on carbs consumed at a meal. You can learn more at sugarsurfing.com."
"If I have a beer, do I need to count the carbs in it? I usually do but I heard something about alcohol making you go low.",
I read that cottage cheese is a good snack to eat. Are there other alternatives because I don’t like cottage cheese.,"Cottage cheese is a nutrient-dense food, but it doesn’t have magical properties. If you are looking for a protein alternative for cottage cheese, you might like a cheese stick, lean lunch meat, hardboiled egg, nut butter, or beef jerky."
What type of foods prevent a blood sugar spike after meals?,"You may not be able to prevent a blood sugar spike after meals if you do not have enough insulin or medication on board at mealtime. If your medications are in order, eating high-fiber foods and limiting carbohydrate intake will help prevent a spike. Also, including a small amount of healthy fat can help to stabilize blood sugar."
What is a good pre-bedtime snack to prevent lows?,"Many people do not need a bedtime snack prior to going to bed, and eating one can add extra calories that make weight management difficult. If your blood sugar is below target range at bedtime, a very general guideline would be to consume 15 grams of carbohydrate and a protein serving. This could be half of a sandwich, some apple slices and peanut butter, or a high-fiber cereal with milk. This snack recommendation varies based on age, medications/insulin, and many other health factors. Ask your HCP about your bedtime snack needs. They may opt to decrease your medication or insulin dose instead of adding a snack to prevent nighttime lows."
"What is a good percentage of the macronutrients carbohydrate, protein, and fat per meal to maintain a steady sugar level?","There is no ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat that applies to all people with diabetes. Your individualized recommendations will be based on your weight, health goals, metabolic profile including kidney function and lipids, age, food preferences, and more."
"I don’t like eating protein for breakfast, like eggs or meat. What else could I eat for breakfast that’s easy to make and OK for my blood sugar?","Based on your treatment regimen, you might find that adding a protein to your breakfast helps keep you full and your blood sugar stable. You can choose a high-fiber cereal with low-fat milk, whole grain bread with peanut butter, cheese and a piece of fruit, or even some leftovers from last night’s dinner. Breakfast does not need to be breakfast foods — you can figure out how to incorporate your favorites into your meal plan."
