question,answer
What can I eat with type 1 diabetes?,"You can eat just about anything and everything. It’s about learning to balance meals and finding foods that are healthy for you.” As processed foods tend to increase blood sugar more rapidly, it’s best to avoid them, or at least try to limit consumption. Work with a registered dietitian or doctor to develop an eating plan that works for you."
Can I drink alcohol?,"Yes, but in moderation. The American Heart Association defines healthy alcohol consumption as one drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men. Make sure to have some carbohydrate to eat before or while you drink, as alcohol may cause low blood glucose."
Will I need other medication in addition to insulin?,"In short, maybe. Although most type 1 diabetes can be managed with insulin, a healthy diet, exercise, and regular blood glucose testing, some people will need additional treatment. You may also need other medications if you’re managing other conditions in addition to diabetes. For example, since type 1 diabetes increases your risk for heart disease, your doctor may prescribe additional medication if you have high cholesterol or high blood pressure. They may also recommend daily aspirin to protect against heart attack and improve circulation."
What can I do if I don’t experience the warning symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia unawareness)?,"Low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, affects different people differently. While there are common symptoms — weakness, fatigue, tingling in the fingers — not everyone with type 1 diabetes will experience them, according to Diabetes UK. This is especially true for people who have had the condition for a long time. More frequent blood sugar testing, or the use of an insulin pump or continuous glucose monitor can help. You should also work with your healthcare team, who may adjust your blood sugar targets to help avoid episodes of low blood sugar, notes the ADA."
"How should I adjust insulin doses before, during, and after exercise?","It depends on your activity level and types of activities you’re doing, the ADA says. Aerobic exercise like jogging or bike riding can lower blood sugar, while anaerobic workouts like weight training can increase it. Work with your care team to develop an exercise plan and insulin regimen that works for you, and expect some trial and error. Using a continuous glucose monitor during exercise can help you determine how exercise affects you, and provide a guide for insulin dosing. In addition to adjusting your insulin, your care team can help you adjust your carb intake before and after exercise to maintain healthy blood glucose levels."
Will I pass type 1 diabetes onto my children?,"It’s possible. While the exact causes of type 1 diabetes are still unknown, according to the American Diabetes Association, genetics do play a role, particularly when both parents have it. It’s important to note that while the lifestyle choices you make, like what you eat or how often you exercise, can affect your blood glucose with type 1 diabetes, there are a lot of other factors as well, like stress and poor sleep"
"If my father has type 2 diabetes, does that mean that I am more likely to get it also?","You may have the genetic foundation for developing diabetes, but it is not inevitable.  What you hopefully have learned is that lifestyle and food management are so important to staying in good health. Stay active, eat unrefined foods as much as possible, and manage stress levels.  These are the first ingredients to a healthier life."
In the past three days my husband’s breath has smelled strongly acidic. Is this related to his diabetes?,"If his glucose levels have been elevated, he could be breaking down fat for fuel at a rapid rate.  This produces ketones, which can produce fruity or acidic breath.  You can purchased ketone strips at the pharmacy to test urine for the presence of ketones. If this persists and if his glucose stays elevated in spite of any efforts on his part for correction, have him see his physician.   "
My 12 year old daughter has been diagnosed with pre-diabetes from a blood test. Is that always type 2?,"Those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes will still produce insulin. A fasting level 126 or greater taken twice is considered a diagnosis of diabetes.  Pre-diabetes is generally 100-125, but you will see different ranges for what is considered normal with some thinking that 80 is an ideal fasting level. A 12-yr old girl will fluctuate with menses onset and because she is still growing.  Developing healthy eating/lifestyle habits now is most important."
How do I find out whether I am type 1 or type 2 diabetes? ,"There are tests that can determine levels of natural insulin production. If you are truly type 1, you require insulin in order to live, usually via daily injections. With type 2, some people take insulin to help get glucose levels under control, but by adopting a more healthy lifestyle with diet/exercise, levels can begin to come under better control and insulin/medication may not required."
I read that people with diabetes should not use heating pads. Why not?,This recommendation is more of a caution for those who have neuropathy and may not feel if the pad gets too hot and could be burned as a result.
Do I need to fast before having an A1C test?,"No, fasting is not required for an A1C because the test measures your average blood glucose levels over the past three months. "
What is an A1C test?,"The A1C test higher your A1C level is, the poorer your blood sugar control and the higher your risk of diabetes complications."
Is diabetes causing me to be tired and sleepy after eating?,"Elevated blood sugar levels send a signal to the brain to release serotonin, a hormone that is both calming and sleep inducing.  If a meal is high in carbs, that converts to sugar more quickly, elevating levels that may already be high and causing even more sleepiness. Eating more unrefined foods and walking will be a step toward better control and alertness.  "
Can my A1C be high if my fasting readings are lower than 130?,"If you have never been tested for a 3 hour glucose tolerance test, showing how you react at 1, 2, and 3 hour intervals. It may be that you spike higher during those times, accounting for higher A1C. You can also start testing your glucose one hour after meals to see how high you rise, especially on those “bad” days. Track your food intake during that time to see what foods may be spiking you the most."
What is ketoacidosis and what are the symptoms?,"Ketoacidosis is the build-up of ketones (a by-product of rapid fat breakdown in the body) and can be life-threatening if left untreated.  This would generally not occur unless glucose levels were very elevated over a longer period where the cells, needing fuel, rapidly break down fat to help keep you alive.  At that point, one may be in a diabetic coma.  In pregnancy, it is important for good control to prevent ketoacidosis so ketone bodies do not form, as they can cross the placenta and be toxic to the fetus.  Symptoms may include fruity smelling breath, high blood sugar, excessive thirst, frequent urination, nausea and vomiting.  If concerned, you can buy strips at the pharmacy to test urine for the presence of ketones."
Why do I need to fast for 10 hours before a fasting glucose blood test?,"This time frame gives your body a chance to digest all food in your system to more readily determine what your true fasting blood sugar is. Carbs, proteins and fats all digest at a different rate and a larger meal will take longer to digest. A fasting blood sugar of 126 repeated twice is a diagnosis of diabetes. "
Does drinking black coffee impact a fasting test?,"Caffeine is a central nervous system stimulator, and may have a short term effect on blood sugars. Only water should be consumed prior to testing."
How would I know if I am diabetic? What are the signs? ,"Frequent urination, rapid weight loss, dizziness, and excessive thirst are just some of the symptoms associated with, but not exclusive to diabetes.  This is certainly truer of those on the path to type 1 diabetes.  Many others will only know by getting a blood test to see if their fasting levels are elevated. 100-125 is generally considered pre-diabetes, 126 and greater with 2 tests is a diagnosis of diabetes.  I suggest you request a fasting glucose test for starters."
"If I have some of the risk factors for diabetes, how often should I be tested to find out if I do have it or not? ","If you are not experiencing any symptoms, an annual physical should be enough. Your glucose levels should be under 100; ideally between 80-90. If you are experiencing any symptoms such as weakness, frequent urination, increased hunger or thirst, or frequent infections, then get a fasting test now."
Is it possible to stop being diabetic?,"Once you have diabetes, you will always have it, but you can manage it to the point that it appears as if you don't have it. What this means is that you can get your blood sugars under control and within normal ranges, and maintain the healthy lifestyle required to stay within range. Learn all you can at this time on how to manage diabetes and live with it. You will find, for the most part, that an active lifestyle with healthy foods in moderate amounts will allow you a ""normal"" quality life."
My fingertips hurt from testing. Does it matter if I get my blood sample from somewhere else on my body?,"Fingertips (on the sides of tips) offer a more reliable capillary flow and reading because changes in glucose levels are detected here more rapidly. This is especially important when treating hypoglycemia. If you wish to use an alternative site such as your forearm or thigh where the blood flow is less, make sure you are using a meter that requires a smaller blood sample. You may want to discuss this with your physician."
I am new to diabetes and am having trouble sticking myself for testing my blood sugar.,"The first step in pricking your finger is to wash your hands with soap and water when at home. Make sure your hands are warm, and have your hand pointing down so the blood can flow to the tips. Pick any finger, using another finger to support it or lay it on its side so that you can stick the side of the tip, not directly on the tip of the finger. There are many nerve endings in your tips, and this area can be very sensitive. The good news is that the meters today require very little blood. You need to either ask your pharmacist or your physician's office to help get you started. Once you are shown, then you can practice and more assured of the readings you are getting."
Does obesity cause type 2 diabetes?,"Obesity is not the cause of type 2 diabetes, but is a strong contributor if one is genetically disposed. In my many years of counseling, I have seen very few folks with a BMI over 30 - in the obese classification - that don't have elevated or elevating glucose. Increased body fat appears to interfere at the cellular level with the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream into the cell: the job of insulin. This creates a condition called insulin resistance. Unless lifestyle changes are made towards better eating habits and activity, pre-diabetes will usually blossom into diabetes."
" If a 13 year old is diagnosed with diabetes, is it always type 1 and necessary to be on insulin or can it be controlled by diet? ","No, the diagnosis of a child is not always type 1 diabetes. With childhood obesity so common now, we are seeing type 2 diabetes at much younger ages. Those who are truly type 1 require insulin to live. If your child is not requiring insulin at this time, it may be true that he/she may need it in the future if the pancreas is on a path to no longer being able to produce insulin. There are tests that can help determine this. Discuss this with your physician. Following a healthy lifestyle and eating whole foods is most important with or without medication."
How can I help my young adult son with type 1 diabetes get a good night sleep? He has trouble falling and staying asleep. ,"Many people have this problem and there is no one answer. The first goal would be to maintain stable glucose levels, as fluctuating levels can certainly affect good sleep. A cup of hot herbal sleep tea 1/2 before bed may help him relax and be able to fall asleep easier. Supplementing with Melatonin, a sleep hormone produced by the body, can often help. Quieting his mind is key; some people benefit by listening to relaxation tapes at night. Exercise during the day can also make for better sleep at night. The most important factor is that he wants to take steps to sleep better and overall maintain a better quality of life."
"I read that with type 2 diabetes, the production of insulin goes down with age. Does it ever go down to nothing? Is it possible to test how much insulin my body still produces? ","It is possible to have your production of insulin cease over time, but usually this is not the case for type 2 diabetes. It is even less likely if you live a healthy lifestyle for both diet and activity. You can have your insulin output measured with a C-Peptide test. If your body truly no longer makes insulin, as the case with type 1 diabetes, and you are not injecting insulin, you will die. There are those with type 2 diabetes who do require insulin to have any semblance of good levels, but can survive without insulin for some period of time, but with high levels.  "
"If a 13 year old is diagnosed with diabetes, is it always type 1 and necessary to be on insulin or can it be controlled by diet? ","No, the diagnosis is not always type 1 diabetes at a young age, as was typically more so in past years. With childhood obesity so common now, we are seeing type 2 diabetes at much younger ages. Those who are truly type 1 require insulin to live. If your child is not requiring insulin at this time, it may be true that he/she may need it in the future if the pancreas is on a path to no longer being able to produce insulin. There are tests that can help determine this. Discuss this with your physician. Following a healthy lifestyle and eating whole foods is most important with or without medication."
Does having lows blood sugar readings of 60 or 70 affect my A1C level? ,"A1C is a 1.5 to three month average of your glucose levels. It does not specify highs vs. lows. The goal of good control is not to have erratic swings in sugars, as this creates wear and tear on the neuropathic system. Being in the 70's is very normal (symptom free) for many people and better overall than levels over 100. Just continue to follow a very healthy lifestyle with attention to eating unrefined foods as much as possible, as blood sugars are always subject to change over the life cycle."
Can I drink water during the two hour period before testing my blood sugar?,"Of course! Water is a major nutrient, as we are composed of at least 60% water. It is calorie free, so it will not raise your blood sugar. It is most important that you stay well hydrated, as elevated glucose can be most dehydrating, leading to headaches and dizziness. The textbook recommendation is to drink half your body weight in ounces of water throughout the day."
Can a diabetic use a hot tub? ,"This has been a controversial issue for some time, but should really be treated on an individual basis. The first consideration is that the hot tub should be very clean, which would probably rule out many commercial tubs that accommodate lots of people in a day. Don't go in with any open sores, cuts, etc. Poor circulation in hands/feet may also be cause for avoidance if one has reduced ability to sense high heat. If your physician doesn't see an obstacle, start with a few minutes, working up to a maximum of about ten. Be mindful of chlorine which may be irritating."
 Do people with diabetes need to use special toothpaste? ,"Generally speaking, no, because you are not ingesting toothpaste. However, you do want to pay attention to the ingredients in things like cough syrup and other medicaitons over the counter that may have sugar in them. Many products have sugar free versions. Always ask your pharmacist when you aren't clear about the best product to buy for diabetes."
"It has been just a few weeks since my diagnosis of type 2 Diabetes and I am a bit freaked out because I've yet to see anybody mention their A1c being anywhere in the same ball park as mine, which is 11. Am I in huge trouble or what? ","That is very high and needs to come down somewhat gradually so as not to experience feelings of low blood sugars. Taking charge of your food and lifestyle is the path to stay on. Insulin at this time may help to detoxify your beta cells, giving your pancreas a rest while you move into a more normal range. Be patient with yourself, but diligent. You didn't develop diabetes over night; you may have been pre-diabetic for some time. The closer you get to more normal weight, the better your chances for better control with less medication."
Why are people with diabetes supposed to be so careful about treating cuts and other injuries?,"A person who has poorly controlled diabetes may find it takes longer to stop the bleeding or to heal the cut. This the same caution for any wound, especially on the feet, which is why people with diabetes are encouraged to check feet daily for even a small splinter. If you maintain good levels that have been established with your physician, then healing times should be similar to anyone else who is basically healthy."
Can diabetes cause a person's feet to have a bad odor? ,"Diabetes left unchecked may be involved in a foot infection, which can certainly cause an odor. Any build up of bacteria or fungus can do the same. Be sure your feet are thoroughly washed with soap before bed, inspect your feet for any cuts, splinters, etc, and when wearing socks, they should be cotton. A yearly visit to a podiatrist is recommended for persons with diabetes. I suggest you at least pose this question to your physician."
Can the low blood sugar that I experience from time to time be a sign that I could be heading down the road to diabetes? ,"Right now, it is most important that you learn to eat correctly for hypoglycemia (i.e. low blood sugar). This would mean to eat a small meal or snack every few hours. Food should be unrefined: no sugary starchy white stuff. Instead, eat lots of veggies, legumes and fish if you eat it. A handful of dry roasted nuts can curb a low blood sugar episode. What's needed are small doses of protein. Left unchecked over time, it is possible for hypoglycemia to advance into hyperglycemia, and then on to diabetes."
"Why do I get extremely tired and fall asleep after eating a meal? This is true when I eat any food with greater simple sugars, desserts especially. I am sleepy within an hour of eating.","You are most likely ""carb sensitive"", which means that those refined carbohydrates will quickly turn into sugar in your body, and release a good dose of serotonin to the brain. This is a hormone that has a very calming effect and, for someone like yourself, will help to put you to sleep! I would suggest you now experiment with eating only complex carbs and shifting more into veggies, fish, and legumes for awhile to see if that helps you become more alert. This will also help your blood sugar numbers come down."
"What is ""Brittle Diabetes""?","""Brittle"" is a term used when one has had diabetes for a long time, and in spite of a solid focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle and good medication management, it becomes harder to control blood sugars. This is more often the case with insulin dependent diabetes. Some folks do better with an insulin pump in such cases."
Why do I feel shaky when my blood sugar is under 90?,"Blood sugar provides fuel for the brain, heart, and for our whole system.  All forms of food eventually are turned into sugar so it is important to understand how carbs, fats and protein convert to sugar in order to keep a steady stream of fuel into the system.  Each of us has a different threshold for fuel needs.  Eating an unrefined diet made up of whole, unprocessed foods is the best way to begin a more stable foundation.  If you have other health conditions or are taking medications, these can also affect your thresholds and should be discussed with your health care provider.    "
"Can very low blood sugars cause depression and cause someone to act like a different person, ex. extreme anger and hostility?","Erratic blood sugars can cause mood swings, such as one would expect with untreated bipolar disorder. If you have ever gone for long periods without food and experienced a feeling of irritability as a result, magnify that many times for blood sugars dropping suddenly too low, or blood sugars that roller coaster day to day. I hope that this person is willing to do what is suggested to get glucoses into a more normal range."
I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and now I have my first bought of cold/ bronchitis since my diagnosis. How do I know when I should see my doctor vs. let the illness run its course?,"When you have diabetes and are ill enough to where your blood sugars go too high and/or your illness doesn’t come under control in a normal course, you should certainly seek medical attention. Stay well hydrated. With diabetes, you may find you now respond to illness differently so do not hesitate to talk to your health care team if you have any questions."
How can I prevent diabetes? I am 14 and overweight and diabetes runs in my family.,"Be very active, and learn as much as you can about healthy eating. Learn to love anything from the veggie world, and make fruits your choice when you crave something sweet. Drink plenty of water and cut out sodas, chips and other snack “junk” foods. Just because there is diabetes in your family, it doesn’t mean you have to get it if you start now with lifestyle changes. Learn as much as you can."
How does smoking affect diabetes?,"Diabetes is considered a cardiovascular disease and smoking negatively affects the cardiovascular system. Smoking also depletes the body of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), a major antioxidant - a cell protector - and can deposit lead and other unwanted chemicals into the fatty tissues of the body. This can definitely interfere with metabolism and good blood sugar control."
 What impact would my husband’s diabetes have on our future child if we decide to have a baby?," It is not a given that you would give birth to a child with diabetes though the genes may be present. The most important focus would be for him to first get blood sugars under control and be in good health. (Yes, this is important for the father as well as the mother). Then, follow a healthy lifestyle as the child grows, to avoid some of the triggers that might manifest later in life. This applies to both type 1 and type 2 diabetes."
"Does fasting make diabetes symptoms worse? My doctor also told me that if I lose all the weight I need to, the condition would disappear. Is this true?","In general blood sugars are far better managed with a controlled, regular eating pattern. Erratic eating, such as fasting and then eating large amounts, is perceived by the body as ""binge"" eating. Your doctor is right in that diabetes is very well managed when one is living a healthy lifestyle. Weight loss is secondary to consistently good habits."
Do I use the first or the second drop of blood when testing my blood sugar?,"With most strips now, you can touch them with the first drop. It takes far less blood than it used to in order to get a good sample. One drop is all that is needed."
Is it OK for my 14 year old daughter with type 1 diabetes to get her belly button pierced or a small tattoo? ,"This is touchy. As a general rule, we say piercings/tattoos are not good ideas because they can be an invitation to infection. I suggest you consult with the nurse in her physician's practice. The conditions would have to be most sterile for any piercings - or pedicures for that matter. If your daughter's blood sugars are in exquisite control, and your medical team knows of a place that has met some standard, then something small may work, particularly if your daughter is rebellious, and would go out and do this on her own, but in poor conditions. Weigh and balance your decision after some detective work."
What is the best way to test for type 1 diabetes? Is there a chance that a blood test is wrong?,"Type 1 diabetes means that without taking insulin, you cannot live. There are those who still produce some insulin, but not at sufficient amounts so to control their blood sugars without taking insulin. This is referred to as type 1.5 diabetes. Your physician can order a C-Peptide test which can give you some idea of how much insulin your pancreas is producing. Type 1 diabetes often comes on fast and strong, with rapid weight loss, thirst, frequent urination, then stabilizes for a period until the cells stop insulin production. Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1."
How does diabetes affect your mood and thinking process?,"With or without diabetes, when blood sugars are not in balance, fatigue, dizziness, ""fuzzy"" thinking, mood swings, and other symptoms may result. With insulin-requiring diabetes, this can be an even greater challenge to maintain stable blood sugars, but is very achievable with the right monitoring and support. Having a disease like diabetes does provide greater challenges for stable health and moods, but does not negate the ability to attain and maintain them."
Will losing a large amount of weight help me to avoid the diabetes that runs in my family? I am 19 years old and very overweight. I recently took my blood sugar a few times and the results scared me: 170 when I woke up. ,"Changing your lifestyle which will ultimately result in body composition changes and weight reduction can certainly keep diabetes in check. You surely have a wake-up call, and now is the time to get guidance in eating and begin a regular exercise program. Be most dedicated to yourself now, as 170 fasting would indicate diabetes. With perseverance, you can stay in control."
Can a type 2 diabetic become a type 1 diabetic after several years and how can I find out? My recent blood test showed that my pancreas is 1.5 and I understand this is very low.,"Yes, you can become type 1 after years of being type 2. What this would mean is that you cannot live without taking insulin. It sounds as though you had a C-Peptide test, and discovered that your insulin reserves are low. If you have a practitioner in your area who understands nutritional therapies, this may help preserve and improve what insulin production you have. Eat whole, unrefined, organic foods as much as possible. Stay active, and work on the ""tough"" one: stress reduction."
 I have type 1 diabetes. What are the chances that my child will develop type 1 as well?,"While there is a genetic component to type 1 diabetes, environmental factors play a role as well. Research suggests that genes account for less than halfthe risk for developing type 1 diabetes. 90% of children who develop type 1 diabetes do not have a relative with this disease and it is reported that only 15% of people with type 1 diabetes have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, with diabetes. There are certain genes called HLA markers associated with diabetes risk which can be identified at birth. Research is ongoing and very active in the field of diabetes and genetic markers soupdated information could be available in the near future."
