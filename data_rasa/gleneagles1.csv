 What are the causes of Diabetes Mellitus?,"Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas (a gland behind the stomach), regulates high level of glucose in the blood. Food that is digested is converted to glucose and rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream when you eat. An increase in blood sugar causes the pancreas to produce and secrete insulin to absorb glucose. Without insulin, glucose cannot be broken to produce energy. In diabetes, your body is either unable to produce enough insulin or use the insulin produced."

Risk factors for Type 1 diabetes: Family history of type 1 diabetes (genetic predisposition). Younger age – higher likelihood of being diagnosed as a child, teenager, or young adult. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes: Family history of type 2 diabetes. Overweight. Unhealthy diet. Physically inactive. Smoking.

 Do people with diabetes have sugar present in their urine?,"Normally, when blood sugar (glucose) rises to a level above 0.25mg/ml in the blood, sugar will appear in the urine. This condition is known as glucosuria."
Are people with diabetes restricted from consuming sugar?,"Diabetes is not caused only by sugar consumption. However, you should still limit your intake of sugary beverages and sweets. Understandably, people get confused about the role of sugary foods and beverages in diabetes. This may be due to the fact that the food you consume is digested and converted into a form of sugar known as glucose. In diabetes, your body is either unable to produce enough insulin or use the insulin produced. Therefore, the excess glucose remains in the blood and your blood sugar level increases."
 Can insulin cure diabetes?,"Insulin does not cure diabetes; it is used to treat diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes are required to inject insulin as their body is unable to produce insulin. On the other hand, type 2 diabetes can be treated with oral medications but may also require insulin, particularly if other medications are not effective at maintaining your blood sugar levels within a healthy range."
Are people with diabetes more prone to cold and other illnesses?,"High blood sugars weaken the person's immunity and result in more frequent infections such as colds, skin infections, urine infections, boils, and abscesses. Hence, it is important to have good glucose control."
