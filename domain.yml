 utter_diabetes_meaning:
 - text: "Diabetes is a chronic condition that occurs when the body is unable to properly use and store glucose (a type of sugar). Glucose is the body's main source of energy, and it comes from the foods we eat. In people with diabetes, the body either does not produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or the cells do not respond properly to insulin. As a result, glucose builds up in the blood instead of being used for energy. There are three main types of diabetes: Type 1 diabetes; this type of diabetes is an autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. As a result, people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin injections to control their blood sugar levels"
 utter_symptoms:

 - text: "Signs and symptoms of diabetes include: intense thirst, frequent urination, particularly at night, unexplained weight loss, increased appetite, fatigue, slow-healing wounds. The symptoms of Type 1 diabetes may develop rapidly over days and weeks In contrast, those with type 2 diabetes may not be aware of their condition as the symptoms may only be evident later"

 utter_risks:
 - text: "Diabetes can lead to a number of serious health complications if not properly managed. Some of the potential complications include cardiovascular disease, kidney damage, nerve damage, eye damage, foot damage and increased risk of infection. In gestational diabetes high blood sugar levels in the mother can increase risk of complcations during pregnancy and child birth. It is important for people with diabetes to carefully manage their condition to reduce their risk of complications. This includes taking medications as prescribed, eating a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and monitoring their blood sugar levels"

 utter_contributing_factors:
 - text: "There are several factors that can contribute to the development of diabetes, including: genetics where if you have a family history of diabetes you may be more likely to develop the condition; obesity in that excess weight especially around the waist increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes; lack of physical activity where people who are inactive are more likely to develop diabetes, as physical activity helps to regulate blood sugar levels; poor diet in the sense that diet high in refined carbohydrates, such as sugary drinks and snacks can increase the risk of diabetes"

 utter_diabetes_types:
 - text: "There are three main types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, this type of diabetes is an autoimmune disease, in which the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. As a result, people with type 1 diabetes need to take insulin injections to control their blood sugar levels; type 2 diabetes, this is the most common type of diabetes, and it is often associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. In type 2 diabetes, the body becomes resistant to the effects of insulin, and the pancreas may not produce enough insulin to meet the body's needs; gestational diabetes, this type of diabetes occurs during pregnancy and usually goes away after delivery. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life"

 utter_diabetes_test:
 - text: "There are several tests that can be used to diagnose diabetes, including: fasting blood sugar test: this test measures your blood sugar after an overnight fast. A normal fasting blood sugar level is less than 100 mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes. Oral glucose tolerance test: this test measures your blood sugar after you have fasted for at least 8 hours and then again 2 hours after you drink a sweet beverage. A normal blood sugar level is less than 140 mg/dL, 2 hours after the beverage. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher indicates diabetes. A1C test: This test measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. An A1C level of 6.5% or higher indicates diabetes. Random blood sugar test: This test measures your blood sugar at any time of day, regardless of when you last ate. A blood sugar level of 200 mg/dL or higher, along with symptoms of diabetes (such as frequent urination, excessive thirst, and unexplained weight loss), may indicate diabetes"   

 utter_treating_for_diabetes:
 - text: "Medical interventions that may be used to treat diabetes include: insulin injections: People with type 1 diabetes and some people with type 2 diabetes may need to take insulin injections to help regulate their blood sugar levels. Oral medications: there are several oral medications that can be taken to help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Continuous glucose monitoring: this involves wearing a device that measures blood sugar levels continuously throughout the day and night. Insulin pumps: These devices deliver a continuous supply of insulin through a small tube that is inserted under the skin"

 utter_prevention_for_diabetes:
 - text: "There are several things that you can do to reduce your risk of developing diabetes or prevent progression to diabetes if one has prediabetes: maintain a healthy weight, excess weight especially around the waist, increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Exercise regularly, physical activity can help to regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Eat a healthy diet; a diet that includes a variety vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins can help to regulate blood sugar levels. Avoid sugary drinks and snacks and limit your intake of refined carbohydrates. Don't smoke as it increases the risk of developing diabetes and can worsen the complications of the disease.Get regular medical check-ups; if you are at high risk of developing diabetes, your doctor may recommend that you have your blood sugar levels checked regularly. All this is is necessary because once you develop diabetes it can not be cured but only managed"

 utter_diabetes_management:
 - text: "Managing diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes and medical interventions.To manage your diabetes, you should: take your medications as prescribed; if you are prescribed insulin or oral medications, be sure to take them as directed by your healthcare team. Test your blood sugar regularly as recommended by your healthcare team. Exercise regularly. Monitor your blood pressure; high blood pressure can increase the risk of complications in people with diabetes. Diabetes can cause nerve damage and poor circulation, which can increase the risk of foot problems. Take care of your feet by washing them daily, wearing comfortable shoes, and checking your feet regularly for cuts, blisters, and other problems"

 utter_diabetes_diet:
 - text: "People with diabetes should aim to follow a healthy eating plan that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods, moderate portion sizes and regular meals. They should choose carbohydrates that are high in fiber and limit added sugars. It is important to monitor blood sugar levels and work with a healthcare professional to develop a diet plan that meets individual needs."
